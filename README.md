# void
I say I'm busy everyday
Just to feel I don't obey
I think I'll leave without a trace
So I never fall from grace

Just want me, just need me
Just say that I'm your baby
I love you then kill you
When I see you I go
Woohoowhooo

Have I found somebody new
Or is it just another you?
I feel the flood is on its way
Are we strong enough to stay?

Just want me, just need me
Just say that I'm your baby
I haunt you then kill you
When I see you I go
Woohoowhooo
