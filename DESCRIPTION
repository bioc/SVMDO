Description: It is an easy-to-use GUI using disease information for detecting tumor/normal sample
    discriminating gene sets from differentially expressed genes. Our approach is based on an 
    iterative algorithm filtering genes with disease ontology enrichment analysis and 
    wilk and wilkâ€™s lambda criterion connected to SVM classification model construction. 
    Along with gene set extraction, SVMDO also provides individual prognostic marker detection. 
    The algorithm is designed for FPKM and RPKM normalized RNA-Seq transcriptome datasets.
