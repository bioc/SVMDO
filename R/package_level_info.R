#' @description Package Description:
#' It is an easy-to-use GUI using disease information for detecting tumor/normal sample
#' discriminating gene sets from differentially expressed genes. Our approach is based on an 
#' iterative algorithm filtering genes with disease ontology enrichment analysis and 
#' wilk's Lambda-based feature selection. The discriminative characteristics of 
#' feature sets are tested with Support Vector Machine.The GUI also allows applying single gene 
#' prognostic analysis by using discriminative feature set.
